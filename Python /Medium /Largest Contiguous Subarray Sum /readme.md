Largest Contiguous Subarray Sum
Akuna Capital Python Interview Question

Given an integer array, find the sum of the largest contiguous subarray within the array.

For example, if the input is [−1, −3, 5, −4, 3, −6, 9, 2], then return 11 (because of [9, 2]).

Note that if all the elements are negative, you should return 0.

p.s. this is the same as question 9.5 in Ace the Data Science Interview.

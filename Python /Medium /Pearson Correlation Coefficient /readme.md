Pearson Correlation Coefficient
AQR Python Interview Question

Given two vectors, represented as lists X and Y, return the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

p.s. this is the same as question 9.8 in Ace the Data Science Interview.

p.p.s. AQR is a competitive hedge fund so they test their Quants & Data Science on both coding & math/stats skills, so they expect you to know the Pearson correlation coefficient formula.

But, if you don't know the formula, don't worry â€“ just use the hints below to learn more about Pearson correlation ðŸ‘‡

Hint #1

Correlation is a statistical measure used to assess the degree of similarity between two sets of vectors in a multi-dimensional space. Here's the formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient:

Corr[X,Y]= Ïƒ[X]âˆ—Ïƒ[Y]/Cov[X,Y]
â€‹
 

In the above equation, the numerator is the covariance of X and Y, and the denominator is the product of the standard deviation of X and the standard deviation of Y.

If you aren't sure how to calculate covariance of two vectors, use the next hint!
